🔐 Secret Code Generator - Caesar Cipher

A fun and simple Python project to **encode** and **decode** secret messages using the **Caesar cipher** technique.

📌 Project Description

The **Secret Code Generator** allows users to transform regular text into secret code by shifting the alphabet letters by a specified number. It also allows decoding the message back to its original form.

This project was built to practice:

- 🧠 Functions and modular programming
- 🔁 Loops and control flow
- 🔡 String manipulation
- 💬 Handling user input and validation

⚙️ Features

✅ Encode messages using Caesar cipher  
✅ Decode encoded messages back to original  
✅ Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters  
✅ Ignores spaces, numbers, and punctuation  
✅ Menu-driven interface  
✅ Handles invalid inputs and edge cases

🖥️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to choose:
   - Encode a message
   - Decode a message
   - Exit
2. The user inputs a message and a **shift number**.
3. Each letter in the message is shifted accordingly:
   - Example: `A` with a shift of `2` becomes `C`
4. Decoding simply shifts in the reverse direction.

📸 Sample Output

```text
===== Secret Code Generator Menu =====
1. Encode a message
2. Decode a message
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter the message to encode: Hello, World!
Enter the shift number (integer): 3
Encoded Message: Khoor, Zruog!
